<h2>About Me</h2>    
<p>I am Ms. Roni Allen, your instructor for CIS 162. I am a new instructor at Cerritos and was an emergency hire. I have been a part time instructor at CSULB for 22 yrs. Most of the classes I have taught there are Web courses. The first course I taught was called Introduction to the Internet. Obviously, I have had to evolve with the technology and have learned so much. I am excited for this new adventure at Cerritos with all of you. This will be challenging being completely online. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you need anything or have any comments or concerns.</p>

</ol>
